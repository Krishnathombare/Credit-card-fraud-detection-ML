This is the ML model for credit card fraud detection.
The dataset was downloaded from the [ website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection)
The dataset was trained and tested using LogisticRegression model and random forest model which are classification models.
Results of both models are compared.
Confusion matrix and Classification Report for both models are studied.
It was found that accuracy of Random forest model is more.
